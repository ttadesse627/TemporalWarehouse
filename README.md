# Temporal Warehouse

## Function of the Prject

The Asp.net Core Web Api + PostgreSQL and Next.js + Tailwind CSS project that enables store keeper to do the following:

1. Create, Remove and update products
2. Add and remove the quantity of each product
3. View the history of the tractions and the quantity of the product at a specific time.
4. Avoids concurrency on updating the product and product quantity.

I Used simple clean architecture/repository pattern for structuring the API.
